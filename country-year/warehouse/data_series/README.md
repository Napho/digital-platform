# `data_series`

Here is a list of all the tables that are manually put together by the analysts to support the various visualisation displayed by the DH.
All of these tables are stored in the `data_series` shema in the ddw DB on 213.168.251.124. **Most of these have not been updated in over 2 years & are not maintained.**

I will slowly try and clean up:

1) [datamap_raw.js](https://github.com/devinit/digital-platform/blob/development/nodejs/js/datamap_raw.js)

2) [concepts.csv](https://github.com/devinit/digital-platform/blob/development/concepts.csv)

to make sure that the data import sends the data to the right file in the right subfolder.

Each table needs to be mapped to the location on the DH where it is being used.
