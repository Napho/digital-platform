# `multilateral_profile`

Here is a list of all the tables that were developed to support the multilateral profiles. 
All of these tables are stored in the `multilateral_profile` shema in the ddw DB on 213.168.251.124.

I will slowly try and clean up:

1) [datamap_raw.js](https://github.com/devinit/digital-platform/blob/development/nodejs/js/datamap_raw.js)

2) [concepts.csv](https://github.com/devinit/digital-platform/blob/development/concepts.csv)

to make sure that the data import sends the data to the right file in the right subfolder.

# Conventions

If a table ends in a year, e.g., 2015, this means that the table contain monetary values presented in constant prices from that year, so 2015 = 2015 constant prices.

# Issues

Each table needs to be mapped to the location on the DH where it is being used.
