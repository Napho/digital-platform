# `graveyard`

This folder is a temporary folder for all the unused .csv (and other?) files littering the repository.
If a file is not in use, it will be removed. Same goes for entries in [concepts.csv](https://github.com/devinit/digital-platform/blob/development/concepts.csv).
After we've remooved all the unused files & made sure that the DH web app functions correctly, this folder will be removed. 

- graveyard for concepts: https://github.com/devinit/digital-platform/blob/development/country-year/graveyard/concepts.csv
